Prerequisites

- Docker
- Node 

Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
cd yourproject
```

### 2. Environment Variables

   #### Backend -> 

   Create a .env file in the backend directory and add the following environment variables:

   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"

   Replace DATABASE_URL with your PostgreSQL database credentials.

   #### Frontend ->

   Create a .env file in the frontend directory and add the following environment variables:

   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/

   Replace REACT_APP_API_URL with your backend API URL if different.

### 3. Install Dependencies & Run Server/Frontend (make sure 4th step should be completed)

   If you need to install dependencies manually:

   Backend ->

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
   

   Frontend ->

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
   

### 4. Setting Up the Database

   Prisma Setup

   Run the following commands in the backend directory to set up Prisma:

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma db push
```

### 5. Build and Run with Docker

   To build and start the services (both frontend and backend) using Docker, run the following command from the root directory of the project:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

   This command will:
   - Build the Docker images for both the frontend and backend.
   - Start the containers for both services.
   - Set up the database and apply migrations.

### 6. Access the Application

   Frontend: The frontend should be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
   Backend: The backend API should be accessible at http://localhost:5000/api.

### 7. Running Prisma Studio (Optional)

   If you want to manage your database visually, you can use Prisma Studio:

  
```bash
npx prisma studio
```
